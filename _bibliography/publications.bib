                higher-order logic programming. Under this semantics,
                every program has a unique minimum Herbrand model
                which is the greatest lower bound of all Herbrand models
                of the program and the least fixed-point of the immediate
                consequence operator of the program. We also propose an
                SLD-resolution proof procedure which is sound and
                complete with respect to the minimum model semantics.
                We provide a purely extensional theoretical framework
                for higher-order logic programming which generalizes
                the familiar theory of classical (first-order) logic
                programming.},

  abstract  = {Extensional higher-order logic programming proposed in
              \citeJ{CHRW13} has an important limitation: all the
              higher-order predicates that can be defined in a program
              are {\em monotonic} and this disallows many natural
              and useful predicates that do not have this property.
              To bypass this limitation, we extend higher-order
              logic programming with {\em constructive negation}.
              We demonstrate the soundness of the resulting
              proof procedure and describe an actual implementation
              of a language that embodies the above ideas. In this
              way we obtain the first (to our knowledge) higher-order
              logic programming language supporting constructive
              negation and offering a new style of programming that
              genuinely extends that of traditional logic programming.}
