## Compilation

In order to compile hopes you must have installed the GHC compiler version 6 or
higher and the cabal system. You can download GHC from http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

There is a Makefile for convenience, and you can type "make" to the console to
compile the program.

Microsoft Windows compilations are not yet supported but this should be no problem
as far as GHC and cabal are installed in the system.
